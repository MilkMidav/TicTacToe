<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

Tic Tac Toe game, a classic game for two players where each player takes turns marking a grid of 3x3 squares with their X or O. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. It is also known as Noughts and Crosses or Xs and Os. The game is implemented using Java Script.

- The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner
- When all 9 squares are full, the game is over
